# Flow Monitoring Project

This is an Angular project aimed at providing flow monitoring capabilities. The application allows users to track and analyze the flow of various processes or events within a system.

## Features

- Real-time Monitoring: The application provides real-time monitoring of flow data, allowing users to view the current status and progress of different processes.

- Visualization: Flow data is presented using interactive charts and visualizations, making it easy for users to comprehend and analyze the flow patterns.

- Alerts and Notifications: The system can generate alerts and notifications based on predefined rules and thresholds, notifying users of any anomalies or critical situations in the flow.

- Historical Data Analysis: Users can access historical flow data and perform in-depth analysis to identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement.

- Configurable Workflows: The application supports the configuration of custom workflows, allowing users to define their own set of steps and transitions to monitor specific processes.

- User Management: Role-based access control is implemented, enabling administrators to manage user accounts and assign appropriate access levels for different users.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Angular**: Angular is used as the front-end framework to create a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **TypeScript**: The project is developed using TypeScript, which provides static typing and enhanced tooling for Angular development.

- **RxJS**: Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is utilized to handle asynchronous operations, event-based communication, and data stream manipulation.

- **Charting Libraries**: Various charting libraries are used to visualize flow data in a visually appealing manner.

- **Backend Integration**: The Angular application interacts with a Nest.js backend API or services to fetch and update flow data.
