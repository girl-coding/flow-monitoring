## Features

- Real-time Monitoring: The application provides real-time monitoring of flow data, allowing users to view the current status and progress of different processes.

- Visualization: Flow data is presented using interactive charts and visualizations, making it easy for users to comprehend and analyze the flow patterns.

- Alerts and Notifications: The system can generate alerts and notifications based on predefined rules and thresholds, notifying users of any anomalies or critical situations in the flow.

- Historical Data Analysis: Users can access historical flow data and perform in-depth analysis to identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement.

- Configurable Workflows: The application supports the configuration of custom workflows, allowing users to define their own set of steps and transitions to monitor specific processes.

- User Management: Role-based access control is implemented, enabling administrators to manage user accounts and assign appropriate access levels for different users.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Angular**: Angular is used as the front-end framework to create a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **TypeScript**: The project is developed using TypeScript, which provides static typing and enhanced tooling for Angular development.

- **RxJS**: Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is utilized to handle asynchronous operations, event-based communication, and data stream manipulation.

- **Charting Libraries**: Various charting libraries are used to visualize flow data in a visually appealing manner.

- **Backend Integration**: The Angular application interacts with a Nest.js backend API or services to fetch and update flow data.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.14.0 or later)
- Yarn (v1.22.19 or later)
- Angular CLI (v14.2.11 or later)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd monitoring-flow
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn start:dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:4200` to see the application.

## Application Scripts

```bash
# Build the app and its dependencies only
yarn build
# Launch the app accessible at <http://localhost:4200>
yarn start:dev
# Run unit tests
yarn test
# Check coding rules
yarn lint
# Format the .ts files
yarn format
# Detect unused code
yarn deadcode
```

## Angular CLI

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 14.2.11. The following packages and versions are used:

- @angular-devkit/architect: 0.1402.11 (cli-only)
- @angular-devkit/core: 14.2.11 (cli-only)
- @angular-devkit/schematics: 14.2.11 (cli-only)
- @schematics/angular: 14.2.11 (cli-only)

## Development server

Run `yarn start:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
